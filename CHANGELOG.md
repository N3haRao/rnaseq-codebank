# Changelog

Each release is tagged in git (`git tag v0.1.0`). Every run records the commit it used in `provenance.json`.

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-19)

First version of the code bank.

- Steps 01-07: input validation, QC, exploratory analysis (VST, PCA, outlier flags), DESeq2 differential expression with apeglm shrinkage, DE figures, pathway enrichment (fgsea ORA + GSEA on MSigDB or custom GMT gene sets), HTML report with an auto-generated methods paragraph.
- `run_pipeline.R` with run folders, per-step logs, provenance and run summaries; `--based_on` for reruns with changed settings.
- `manifest/tools.yaml` describing every step, parameter and output for the agent.
- Tests on airway and pasilla, including a comparison against a hand-written DESeq2 analysis and planted input errors.
- Developed and tested with R 4.3.3, DESeq2 1.42.0, apeglm 1.27.0, fgsea 1.39.4, msigdbr 26.1.1.
